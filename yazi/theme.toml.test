# Syntax highlighting within the preview pane
# For full syntax highlighting, you'd typically use a `syntect_theme`.
# You need a .tmTheme file that matches your Gruvbox Material Hard palette.
# If you have one, place it (e.g., ~/.config/yazi/gruvbox-material-hard.tmTheme)
# and uncomment/set the path below:
# syntect_theme = "~/.config/yazi/gruvbox-material-hard.tmTheme"
